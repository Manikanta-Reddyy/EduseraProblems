Implicit  --- only widening possible 
Explicit  --- both Widening and Narrowing Possible

Bitwise operators

Bitwise and ex:10&8    (1 only both are 1 other wise 0) (also known as conjunction)

10 = 1010, 8 =1000  (A&B)

Bitwise OR   ex:10|5   (1 atleast 1 otherwise 0)   (A|B)

Bitwise XOR   ex:7^4   (if both are same output will be 0 if both are different output 1)  (A^B)
